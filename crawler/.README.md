## Module Overview
- Playwright-backed workflow execution service exposing a minimal HTTP API for run orchestration.

## Responsibilities
- Validate workflow payloads and schedule runs according to `MAX_CONCURRENCY`.
- Execute workflows step-by-step in real browsers and emit progress events.
- Report health and runtime metrics over `/healthz`.

## Interfaces
- Entry point: `index.js` (`pnpm run dev:runner`).
- HTTP: `POST /run` (body `{ runId, workflow }`), `GET /healthz → { ok, activeRuns, queueDepth }`.
- Event bridge: `src/events.postEvent(runId, payload)` sending data to the portal.
- Environment: `PORT`, `MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `PORTAL_BASE_URL`, `INTERNAL_SECRET`.

## Depends On
- Playwright for browser automation.
- Services in `src/services/` (RunManager, WorkflowValidator).
- Portal internal API for event ingestion.
- Node fetch and dotenv configuration.

## Used By
- Root workspace script `pnpm dev:crawler`.
- Portal workflow routes calling `/run`.
- Monitoring tooling querying `/healthz`.
