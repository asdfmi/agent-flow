## Module Overview
- Shared error types used by the crawler HTTP layer and services.

## Responsibilities
- Provide consistent error signaling (e.g., `RequestError`) with HTTP-aware metadata.
- Encapsulate validation and scheduling failures before they reach Express handlers.

## Interfaces
- `class RequestError extends Error` with properties `{ status, body }`.
- Constructors expect `{ status, body }` and surface `message` for logging.

## Depends On
- Standard `Error` inheritance and consumer-provided payloads.
- Services such as `WorkflowValidator` and `RunManager` populate the error body.

## Used By
- `crawler/index.js` to translate service failures into HTTP responses.
- Service modules needing to abort requests with structured details.
