## Module Overview
- Core source code for the crawler service, grouping the execution engine, validation services, and shared helpers.

## Responsibilities
- Provide workflow execution primitives under `engine/`.
- Expose run orchestration and validation helpers via `services/`.
- Define shared error types and JSON schemas consumed by the HTTP layer.

## Interfaces
- `engine/WorkflowRunner.run()` – main execution entry point.
- `services/RunManager.enqueue({ runId, workflow })` – queue management.
- `services/WorkflowValidator.validate(workflow)` – schema validation.

## Depends On
- Playwright runtime, AJV schema validator, and internal event posting (`src/events.js`).
- Node.js modules imported from parent (`crawler/index.js`).

## Used By
- `crawler/index.js` when handling `/run` requests.
- Any future orchestration tooling that reuses the crawler engine programmatically.
