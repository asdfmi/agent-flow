## Module Overview
- Core execution engine that manages browser sessions, dispatches workflow steps, and evaluates success criteria.

## Responsibilities
- Instantiate and clean up Playwright sessions (`browser-session.js`).
- Sequence workflow steps through `WorkflowRunner` with loop/conditional support.
- Evaluate success conditions and forward run/step events via `RunEventDispatcher`.

## Interfaces
- `new WorkflowRunner({ workflow, runId, postEvent, logger }).run()` – execute a workflow definition.
- Step handler signature: `async function handleX({ runner, step, meta, index }) → { handled?, nextStepId? }`.
- Execution context utilities: `execution-context.js` for variable storage, `success-evaluator.js` for waiting on conditions.

## Depends On
- Playwright session wrapper (`browser-session.js`).
- Shared services (`RunEventDispatcher`, `ExecutionContext`, `SuccessEvaluator`).
- Step handler modules in `steps/` directory.

## Used By
- `crawler/index.js` via `RunManager` when dequeuing workflow runs.
- Step handler modules invoking runner helpers (e.g., `runner.evaluateOnPage`).
- Future custom steps that plug into `STEP_HANDLERS`.
