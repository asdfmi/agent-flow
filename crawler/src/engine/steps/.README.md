## Module Overview
- Step handler implementations that translate workflow definitions into Playwright actions.

## Responsibilities
- Provide one handler per supported step type (navigate, wait, click, fill, etc.).
- Coordinate with `WorkflowRunner` to signal whether execution was handled or should fall back to success evaluation.
- Offer branching helpers for conditional (`if`) and iterative (`loop`) constructs.

## Interfaces
- Each handler exports `async function handleX({ runner, step, meta, index }) → { handled?, nextStepId? }`.
- Handlers consume `runner.page`, `runner.evaluateOnPage`, and emit directives back to the engine.

## Depends On
- `WorkflowRunner` context utilities (browser session, execution state, success evaluator).
- Playwright APIs accessed through the injected runner.

## Used By
- `engine/workflow-runner.js` via the `STEP_HANDLERS` map.
- Future custom steps can follow the same signature and live beside existing handlers.
