## Module Overview
- Service helpers handling workflow validation and run lifecycle coordination for the crawler.

## Responsibilities
- Enqueue and schedule workflow runs with concurrency limits (`run-manager.js`).
- Validate incoming workflow payloads against the JSON schema (`workflow-validator.js`).
- Expose runtime metrics for health checks.

## Interfaces
- `runManager.enqueue({ runId, workflow })` – queue a workflow run; throws `RequestError` on failure.
- `runManager.getMetrics()` – return `{ activeRuns, queueDepth, totalRuns }`.
- `validator.validate(workflow)` – resolve on success or throw with validation details.

## Depends On
- AJV schema at `src/schema/workflow.schema.json`.
- `engine/workflow-runner.js` via the `crawlerFactory`.
- `errors/request-error.js` for propagating client-visible failures.

## Used By
- `crawler/index.js` to process HTTP requests.
- Health endpoint (`GET /healthz`) when reporting metrics.
- Future orchestration layers reusing RunManager or Validator logic.
