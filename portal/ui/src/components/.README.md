## Module Overview
- Shared presentation and layout components reused across portal pages.

## Responsibilities
- Encapsulate MUI-based UI patterns (navigation, modals, step metadata display).
- Provide composable building blocks for pages without duplicating logic.

## Interfaces
- Example exports: `NavBar`, `ExecutionViewerModal`, `WorkflowStepList`, `stepMeta` helpers.
- Components expect props documented inline within each file.

## Depends On
- React, MUI, Emotion styling, and internal hooks/data objects.

## Used By
- Pages under `pages/` and feature-specific components (e.g., workflow builder).
- Future UI modules needing consistent look and feel.
