## Module Overview
- Custom React hooks that encapsulate data fetching and state for portal workflows.

## Responsibilities
- Bridge UI components with REST endpoints and WebSocket streams.
- Manage loading/error states and expose memoised helper actions.

## Interfaces
- `useWorkflowRun(runId)` – returns `{ run, events, isLoading, refresh }`.
- `useWorkflows()` and other hooks documented per file.

## Depends On
- API clients in `../api/`, browser `WebSocket`, and React state primitives.

## Used By
- Components and pages requiring workflow or run data.
- Future hooks building atop existing fetch utilities.
