## Module Overview
- Top-level React pages rendered for the operator portal (workflows, builder, admin).

## Responsibilities
- Define page-specific layouts, routing entry points, and bootstrapping code.
- Compose feature components and hooks to deliver complete screens.

## Interfaces
- Each subdirectory exposes `main.jsx` (bootstrap) and `App.jsx` (page component).
- Pages rely on data hooks (`hooks/`) and shared UI components.

## Depends On
- React routing/bootstrapping logic via Vite entry points.
- Shared API and component modules under `src/`.

## Used By
- Vite during build to generate distinct HTML bundles per page.
- Portal server serving compiled `dist/src/pages/*/index.html`.
