## Module Overview
- Workflow builder-specific hooks encapsulating form state and actions.

## Responsibilities
- Manage builder forms, step ordering, and validation logic.
- Expose handlers for mutating workflow definitions from UI components.

## Interfaces
- `useWorkflowBuilderForm(initialWorkflow)` – returns state, mutators, and derived metadata.

## Depends On
- Core workflow hooks (`src/hooks`), workflow API clients, and React state utilities.

## Used By
- Builder components needing access to centralized workflow state.
- Future builder features extending the same form context.
