## Module Overview
- Utility helpers supporting workflow builder state transformations and validations.

## Responsibilities
- Provide pure functions for manipulating workflow graphs and step metadata.
- Support hooks/components by encapsulating reusable logic.

## Interfaces
- `workflowBuilder.js` exports helpers like `normalizeWorkflow`, `createDraftStep`, etc.

## Depends On
- Plain JavaScript data structures and workflow schema conventions.

## Used By
- Builder hooks (`../hooks`) and components when transforming workflow state.
- Potential non-UI modules needing the same transformation logic.
