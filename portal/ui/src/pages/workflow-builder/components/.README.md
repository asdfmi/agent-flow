## Module Overview
- Component set supporting the workflow builder experience (node list, config forms, modals).

## Responsibilities
- Render step configuration panels for each step type.
- Provide layout primitives for the builder workflow (lists, detail panels).
- Surface event handlers for adding/removing or configuring steps.

## Interfaces
- Components export standard React components receiving props like `step`, `onChange`, `workflow`.
- Shared helpers (e.g., `StepConfigFields`) orchestrate child component rendering.

## Depends On
- MUI components, shared hooks (`../hooks`), and workflow metadata utilities.

## Used By
- `WorkflowBuilderPage` and related hooks to compose the builder UI.
- Potential future builder extensions needing consistent UI patterns.
