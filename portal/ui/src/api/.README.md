## Module Overview
- Lightweight fetch wrappers for the portal REST endpoints.

## Responsibilities
- Centralise HTTP requests for workflows and admin data.
- Handle JSON parsing and basic error propagation for the UI.

## Interfaces
- `client.js` – exports configured `fetchJson(url, options?)`.
- `workflows.js` – `listWorkflows()`, `fetchWorkflow(id)`, `runWorkflow(id)`, etc.
- `admin.js` – helpers for listing tables and mutating records.

## Depends On
- Browser `fetch` API (polyfilled as needed by the bundler).
- Portal REST routes under `/api`.

## Used By
- Hooks and components within `hooks/` and `pages/` needing data access.
- Potential future data services extending API coverage.
