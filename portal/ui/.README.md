## Module Overview
- React 19 + Vite UI bundle powering the operator console for managing workflows and monitoring runs.

## Responsibilities
- Render workflow list, builder, and admin pages under `src/pages`.
- Provide reusable components/hooks for consuming portal APIs and WebSockets.
- Build distributable assets into `dist/` via Vite.

## Interfaces
- Build/watch: `pnpm run dev:ui` (uses `vite.config.js`).
- Hooks: `hooks/useWorkflowRun`, `hooks/useWorkflows` (return loading state, data, and actions).
- API layer: `api/client.js` exporting fetch helpers for `/api/workflows` etc.
- Entry HTML: generated in `dist/src/pages/*/index.html`.

## Depends On
- React, React DOM, MUI, Emotion styling.
- Portal REST endpoints and `/ws` for data and event streams.
- Vite tooling for module bundling.

## Used By
- Portal server (`server/index.js`) serves assets from `ui/dist`.
- Operators accessing the web UI via browser.
- Automated tests or docs referencing the UI build (future integrations).
