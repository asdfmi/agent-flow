## Module Overview
- Shared server-side utilities, currently housing the Prisma client instance.

## Responsibilities
- Initialise and export a singleton Prisma client connected via `DATABASE_URL`.
- Provide a central import path to avoid multiple client instantiations.

## Interfaces
- Default export: `prisma` (`PrismaClient` instance).
- Consumers call standard Prisma methods (e.g., `prisma.workflow.findMany`).

## Depends On
- Prisma generated client (via `@prisma/client`).
- Environment configuration for database connectivity.

## Used By
- Express routers in `server/routes/*`.
- Any future services requiring direct database access.
