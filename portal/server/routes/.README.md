## Module Overview
- Express routers grouped under `/api` and `/internal` for workflow management and admin utilities.

## Responsibilities
- Provide workflow CRUD and run-dispatch endpoints (`workflows.js`).
- Offer generic admin CRUD helpers (`admin.js`) backed by Prisma.
- Accept authenticated crawler events at `/internal/runs/:runId/events` (`internal.js`).

## Interfaces
- `GET /api/workflows` – list workflows ordered by `updatedAt`.
- `POST /api/workflows` / `PUT /api/workflows/:id` – create or replace workflow definitions.
- `POST /api/workflows/:id/run` – enqueue workflow execution via the crawler.
- `POST /internal/runs/:runId/events` – ingest run events (requires `Authorization: Bearer <INTERNAL_SECRET>`).

## Depends On
- Prisma client (`../lib/prisma.js`) for database interactions.
- Shared event bus (`../events/bus.js`) for broadcasting crawler updates.
- Environment variable `CRAWLER_BASE_URL` to reach the crawler service.

## Used By
- `server/index.js` mounts these routers under `/api` and `/internal`.
- Operator UI (`portal/ui`) consumes the workflow REST API.
- Crawler service posts to the internal event route during run execution.
