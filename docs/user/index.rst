User Guide (Pending)
====================

The end-user guide is currently being drafted. It will cover:

* How to create, edit, and run workflows in the Portal UI
* Runner configuration for different environments
* Troubleshooting common automation issues

In the meantime, follow the quick-start instructions in ``README.md`` to install dependencies and run the stack locally. Updates will be published here once the walkthroughs are ready.
